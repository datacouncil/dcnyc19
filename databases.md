# Databases

This track focuses on databases particularly tailored to data science
tasks, and to the application of machine learning to the construction
of databases. Talks should be about the design of large scale
databases particularly with respect to usage and implementation in a
data science context. Are there certain schemas that are good for
certain tasks? Are there specialized databases aimed at solving
certain classes of problems?

Active database research also poses a variety of optimization
problems, for which we've discovering effective machine learning
algorithms. How does this affect the next generation of databases? How
does machine learning open up new kinds of queries and insights we can
extract from our systems?

This track is for those interested in state of the art data systems
and the new kinds of applications they're enabling.

## Community Suggestions and Comments

Worth noting how NYC is home to several database companies, as noted in this tweet (https://twitter.com/mattturck/status/1158763842287128576): "Of course, @MongoDB. @CockroachDB (just announced $55M Series C). Also @TimescaleDB. And others that have founders living in NYC like @InfluxDB and @quasardb"(@annaheim)

AsterixDB could also be an interesting topic, also for the connection with academia (cf. http://www.odbms.org/blog/2019/01/on-sql-and-couchbase-n1ql-for-analytics-interview-with-mike-carey/) (@annaheim)
